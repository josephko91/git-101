short introduction to git/github

# What is Git and Github?

[*Git*](https://git-scm.com/) is an open-source version control system. It can be used on a local machine, independent of Github. 

*Github* is a cloud-based Git repository hosting website.

Git can exist without Github. Github cannot exist without Git. 

# Downloading Git

First, download Git on your local machine. See the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/) for download links.

## Mac

If you have [homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) installed, simply run the following in your terminal:

```
brew install git
```

## Windows

See instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

## HPC 

Git should already be installed on the USC HPC. By default, an older version of Git be automatically loaded when you log in.

Check the version:
```
git --version
```

As of March 14, 2022, this results in the following output:
